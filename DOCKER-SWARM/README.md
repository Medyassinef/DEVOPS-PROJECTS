#  üê≥ Docker Swarm Project
Welcome to the Docker Swarm Project repository! 
In this project i will use the playground of *PLAY WITH DOCKER* to easily practice the labs of *Docker Swarm*.
This project demonstrates the use of Docker Swarm to orchestrate and manage containerized applications across multiple nodes.

## üåü Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging Docker Swarm for container orchestration. 
Docker Swarm is a native clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers that simplifies the deployment and scaling of services in a distributed environment.

### Key Features:
  Multi-node setup using Docker Swarm.
  
  Service discovery and load balancing.
  
  Fault tolerance and scaling.
  
  Integration with a local Docker Hub for managing container images.
